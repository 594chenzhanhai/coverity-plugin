    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5em">How to configure the Coverity Jenkins plugin</span>

    <p>
        The Coverity Jenkins plugin is designed to efficiently handle several different use cases. This help section
        details how to properly configure the Coverity Jenkins plugin for your environment. You can use the "Check
        Configuration" button to check for errors in your stream configuration. In addition, another check will run
        before each build. This second check will also verify that the analysis environment is compatible with your
        configuration.
    </p>

    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em">Coverity Analysis 8.0.0 or later</span>

    <p>
        Coverity Connect allows you to specify all languages for each stream. Since analysis results are
        combined in version 8.0.0, each stream must be able to receive results for each analyzed language.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            To analyze all languages, make sure your streams are set to the 'Any' language type in Coverity
            Connect. This is the recommended configuration.
        </li>
        <li>
            Streams configured in Coverity Connect to receive single language will be restricted to that language
            when performing a commit.
        </li>
        <li>
            Note that Coverity Analysis versions earlier than 8.0.0 are only supported in past releases of the
            Coverity Plugin.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em">Invoke Coverity Capture Build</span>

    <p>
        If an "Invoke Coverity Capture Build" is configured as one of the build steps, only that build is going to be wrapped around with the cov-build executable to capture build.
        Any other build steps will be performed without the cov-build wrapper.

        If no "Invoke Coverity Capture Build" is configured, then every build step will be wrapped around with the cov-build executable to capture the build.
        This is to support the backward compatibility.
    </p>
