    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5em">How to configure the Coverity Jenkins plugin</span>

    <p>
        The Coverity Jenkins plugin is designed to efficiently handle several different use cases. This help section
        details how to properly configure the Coverity Jenkins plugin for your environment. You can use the "Check
        Configuration" button to check for errors in your stream configuration. In addition, another check will run
        before each build. This second check will also verify that the analysis environment is compatible with your
        configuration.
    </p>

    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em">Coverity Analysis 7.7.0 or later</span>

    <p>
        Coverity Connect allows you to specify one or all languages for each stream. Since analysis results are
        combined in version 7.7.0, each stream must be able to receive results for each analyzed language.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            To analyze all languages, make sure your streams are set to the 'Any' language type in Coverity
            Connect. Then select the 'All' language setting in the Coverity Jenkins plugin in every stream you
            would like to commit results to. This is the recommended configuration.
        </li>
        <li>
            Streams configured in Coverity Connect to receive single language will be restricted to that language
            when performing a commit.
        </li>
        <li>
            Note that Coverity Analysis versions earlier than 7.7.0 are only supported in past releases of the
            Coverity Plugin.
