        Only defects for which action, severity, component and checker are all selected here, will be considered.
        Classification is deliberately not configurable.

        Additionally a cut-off date (yyyy-mm-dd) can be provided. Any defects that were first detected before this date
        will be ignored. This is useful when setting up a base line, so that only newly committed defects are
        considered.
