    <p>
  Defects found by the Coverity analysis are first filtered according to
  the settings here.  If a defect matches all the filters, then it will
  be included in the list of "Coverity Defects" associated with the build,
  and in the defect count trend chart.  Furthermore, if any defect matches
  the filters, and the "Fail the build if matching defects are found" box
  is checked, then the build will be marked as a failure.
    <p>
 Defects are filtered according to action, severity, component,
  checker, classification, impact and date found.  If no value is checked
  for an attribute the filtering will match defects for all known
  values (the behavior with none selected is equivalent to all selected).
  If a date (yyyy-mm-dd) is specified, then only defects found on or after
  that date pass the filter.  This is useful to establish a "base line" of
  existing defects that will be tolerated, whereas new defects will not be.
