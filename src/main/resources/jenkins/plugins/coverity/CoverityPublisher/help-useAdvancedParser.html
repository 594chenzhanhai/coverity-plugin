    When selected, Coverity Jenkins Plugin will parse commands with its enhanced parser. Otherwise, the standard Jenkins
    mechanism for parsing environment variables is used. The enhanced parser interprets each argument individually by evaluating environment variables and, if any are present, tokenizing the result.
    <p>
        This allows you to have environment variables that expand to multiple arguments.
