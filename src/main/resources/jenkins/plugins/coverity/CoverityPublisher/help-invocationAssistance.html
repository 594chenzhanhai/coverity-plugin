When selected, Jenkins will automatically monitor the
   build using cov-build, then invoke cov-analyze or cov-analyze-java
   depending on the language associated with the chosen stream, then
   invoke cov-commit-defects to commit a snapshot to CIM.  When this
   is *not* selected, the job script must do these tasks itself.
