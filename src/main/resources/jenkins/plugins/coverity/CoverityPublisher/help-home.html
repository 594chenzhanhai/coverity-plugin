        Note: The Static Analysis Location is deprecated in Coverity plugin version 1.10 and later. Please use the
        Coverity Static Analysis Tools global configuration instead. Configured global tools installations will be
        used instead of this value, the installation named 'default' will take priority, otherwise the first
        installation would be used.
    </p>

    <p>
        The default path to the Coverity Static Analysis install (it has
        subdirectories "bin", "config", etc.). This is used when running
        Coverity Static Analysis on the master node. Please specify a full path to this installation. For other slaves,
        the location can be overridden on the slave configuration page. If no
        location is set, you should make sure the Coverity Static Analysis
        tools can be found on the PATH.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Coverity Static Analysis tools must already be configured
        with the necessary compilers using cov-configure, and the license
        file must already be in the "bin" directory.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that the minimum supported Coverity Connect external version is 8.0.0.
