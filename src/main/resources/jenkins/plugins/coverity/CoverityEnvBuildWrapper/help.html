    This step will use the specified Coverity Tool Installation and add the bin/ directory to PATH for any steps that
    are wrapped. This will allow the pipeline script to access Coverity tools (like cov-build, cov-analyze, and cov-commit-defects)
    directly from a script step (such as a Shell Script or Windows Batch Script).

    Also, this step optionally allows users to bind the Coverity Connect Instance information (Host/Port/Credentials) to environment variables.
