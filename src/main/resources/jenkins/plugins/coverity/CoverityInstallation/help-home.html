        Note: The node specific Static Analysis Location property is deprecated in Coverity plugin version 1.10 and later.
        Please use the Coverity Static Analysis Tools global configuration instead and override the tools for this node
        if necessary. For backward compatibility this value will still be used for build jobs run on this node, clear
        the value in order to leverage the global tool configuration(s).
    </p>

    <p>
        A node specific path to the Coverity Static Analysis install (it has
        subdirectories "bin", "config", etc.). This is used when running
        Coverity Static Analysis on this node. Please specify a full path to this installation. If no
        location is set, you should make sure the Coverity Static Analysis
        tools can be found on the PATH.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Coverity Static Analysis tools must already be configured
        with the necessary compilers using cov-configure, and the license
        file must already be in the "bin" directory.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that the minimum supported Coverity Connect external version is 8.0.0.
