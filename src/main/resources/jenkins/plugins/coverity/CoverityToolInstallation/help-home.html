        The full path to a Coverity Static Analysis install (it has subdirectories "bin", "config", etc.).
        This tool installation can be used with the `tool` step to invoke any Coverity Static Analysis tools in a pipeline.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Coverity Static Analysis tools must already be configured with the necessary compilers using cov-configure,
        and the license file must already be in the "bin" directory.
    </p>

    <p>
        When running analysis for multiple platforms it is recommended to configure the platform specific tools here by
        path or to add node specific Tool configuration. Node specific tools will need to be configured per pipeline.
