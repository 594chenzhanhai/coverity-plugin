        The Publish Coverity View Results step will retrieve issues from the configured Coverity Connect Instance, Project,
        and View.  This step does not run any Coverity Analysis tools, it only retrieves the latest issues for the configured
        Project and View.  It is recommended to run Coverity analyze and commit as prior step(s) in the pipeline to retrieve
        up to date results.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Instance is configured in the Global Configuration, use the name of the instance or this step.  The
        Project is the string name identifier of the Coverity Connect project.  The View is the name or numeric ID of the
        view to retrieve issues from.  Any filtering details of which issues this pipeline step should use can be configured
        in the Coverity Connect UI, it is recommended to use a custom "Issues: By Snapshot" view for this pipeline.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> if the are multiple streams in the project the view should be configured so the view filter uses only the
        stream for this pipeline.  Additionally, it is recommended to filter the status value to not retrieve any Fixed or
        Dismissed issues.
