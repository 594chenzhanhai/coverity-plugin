    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5em">How to configure the Coverity Build Step</span>
    <p>
        The build step can be configured as any other build steps. Choose the appropriate builder and configure the command to be performed.
        The configured build step will be wrapped with the Coverity cov-build executables so that it captures the build and can be used to further analysis by using coverity static tools.

        This build step is only for capturing build of compiled sources.
