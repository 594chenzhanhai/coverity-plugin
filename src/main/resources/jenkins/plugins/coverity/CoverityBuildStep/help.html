    <p>
        The build step can be configured as any other build steps. Choose the appropriate builder and configure the command to be performed.
        The configured the build step will be wrapped around with the cov-build executables so that it captures the build and can be used to further analysis by using coverity static tools.

        This build step is only for capturing build of compiles sources.
